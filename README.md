# MODIS Re-LWP cloud radiative kernel
This file is the shortwave (SW) cloud radiative kernel for liquid-topped clouds that can be used with joint histograms partitioned by cloud-droplet effective radius (Re) and liquid water path (LWP) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite instrument. Information about the kernel can be found in Wall et al. (2023), and information about the MODIS data can be found in Pincus et al. (2023). The kernel has dimensions of Re, LWP, latitude, surface albedo, and calendar month. This kernel can be transformed from latitude-surface-albedo space to latitude-longitude space with linear interpolation. Wall et al. (2023) transformed this kernel to latitude-longitude space using Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Energy Balanced and Filled (EBAF) ed. 4.1 satellite dataset. The file size for the transformed kernel is too large to post on GitHub, but it can be obtained by emailing the Casey Wall at: casey (dot) wall (at) geo (dot) uio (dot) no

Please cite Wall et al. (2023) when using these kernels in publications.
